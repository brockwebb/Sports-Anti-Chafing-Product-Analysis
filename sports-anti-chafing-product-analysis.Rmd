# Synopsis
There are many different options on the market for anti-chafing in sports. The goal of this analysis was to find the best products at the cheapest price. This required looking at as many products as possible on the market and seek see if the are any patterns in ingredient use that can be correlated to user experience through product ratings. 

Most of the products were obtained from Amazon.com. This has led to interesting consequesnces as side-bar advertisements from Amazon have been offering all kinds of sports lube to more 'personal' products. Even suggestions for interesting underwear have been included as a result of these searches. Interesting in the fast that the underwear includes an extra 'pouch' where the wearer might resemble something more like an elephant (think 'trunk') to add 'extra breeze' for separation and moisture management.

When staring at ingredients and collecting the data, it became difficult to tell the difference between biking products and lotion. Given that cyclists apply this product to both their groin area and the padding or "chamios" (a throwback from when leather may have been used in bike shorts), petrolium products are not friendly to the synthetics in the fabrics used and cause breakdown faster. Also, this was not personally surprising given my experience in using Gold Bond lotion as a quick lube substitute for a run or bike with success. Since staring at labels becames a recent hobby, I've noticed that many of my wife's lotion products contain dimethicone and so does the Gold Bond. 

A point on biking products is that they are essentially lotion targeted at a specific market and maybe their particualr formulation has better efficacy for that region of the body. They are more expensive, but that is just supply and demand, cyclists may pay more for products just because they are labeled as being for cycling. Off-label use may be percieved as a risk because it might be safer in the mind of the consumer to use a product "intended" for something, and this goes for runner/triathlete products as well. Perhaps it is marketing psychology and group identification where ownership of a particular project is a projection of self-identy for belonging in a particualr group by using products that are labeled for the sport.  

About 75% of the products studied contain glycerin, which is water attracting and helps prevent water loss. Twelve of the thirteen products contain water as a prime ingredient as well. By putting on the chamios, it is kind of like a lubricant sponge and reservior that releases anti-chafe during the ride with time, sweat, and pressure squeezing it out. From training for triathlon and applying bike products, I always had streaks of color going down my legs toward the end of a long run on an especially hot/humid or rainy day. Hence, I stopped using these products as soon as I ran out of them, prefering the multi-sport triathlon formulations like Brave Solder and Skin Strong Slather to name a few. Everything sweats out on an ultra anyways, and I don't have a chamois reservior to replace what it spent.

I've had a history with "off-label" products (meaning they were not 'sold' as 'sports' anti-chafing products). This started with applying some hand salve I had because it felt like it would work just fine and it did. During a vacation I developed a blister with from wearing shoes after I had been training minimilist for a while. I grabed some of my son's diaper cream (it says anti-chafe!) and slathered it on my toes... problem solved! During a runing of the Hellgate 100k, I noticed a very seasoned ultrarunner put Butt Stuff on his feet, commenting to an inquisitive runner that it has worked great for him, especially with "wet foot" -- and Hellgate gets your feet and more soaked in the first 3.5 miles or so. Recently I've been using a prodcut intended for horses, but that is not all that surprising given the off-label use I found frequently mentioned on products meant for cows.  


Besides what might be a treasure trove of "off-label" products that might be cheaper substitutes, creative individuals have gone the "roll your own" route with apparent success. These advanced potion makers and sports alchemists have created their own blends of products, plenty of recipes and directions appear on the Internet. Some were even motivated when their favorite foot product (Hydropel) was out of production and necessity is afterall the mother of invention. While interesting, those have not been included, but it might be possible to apply some of the patterns learned to either prove out the home made formulas, improve upon them, or put them into questionable standing. It may be cheaper to make your own, but buying all the ingredients may be incredibly expensive and the resulting amount may be more than one can use in several years. Also, one product is sold in bulk with a very generic sounding name, and may just be a decent one to buy, saving the time and trouble of a home-brew. However, after buying 50 lbs of maltrodecxtrin to make my own running drinks and the resulting reminders from my wife about how long it was taking me to consume it all, a bucket of lube sounds good in theory but would probably take me 20 years to use it all! If anything, the maker culture is something to check out, as reusing gel based deoderiant containers and filling them with lube to create a no-mess applicator are fantistic ideas I have got to try! 


# Methodology
*Please note: all the data files used and complete source code is available from the github repository at: https://github.com/brockwebb/Sports-Anti-Chafing-Product-Analysis*
All data were gathered from public websites on products and their formulations. Ingredient names are not standardidized, so substitutions were made to represent the same ingredient in a uniform way. All of the original label information was preserved, as well as recording "other" names in the ingredient definitions page. Some research was done into defining the products and what they are or do, but that was not the main focus of the study. Compiling such a list would be great for informational purposes in a later effort. Contributions can be made to the product in this area via the GitHub page, in addition to any other innovations that might make this project better.

Product ratings were based on the 'five star' sytem, popular with most online retailers. The percentage of each (1-5) rating was captured or calculated if a percentage was not given. Breaking the products into use catagories was done due to the fact that formulations may be specific to particular activity or location of the body and used to slice apart the data in different ways. If the manufacturer labeled the product for a specific use or sport, it was noted. 


# Environment Setup
## Global Options
Global options set options for general formatting, including suppressing messages and warnings from the code. There are many messages produced that add length to the document and distract from readability. Also, turning on/off all code, chart sizes, etc. to display results is possible here too. 

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6)
```

## Data libraries
The following libraries are used in this analysis:
1. ggplot2 -- graphics/charts
2. grid -- layout of charts for display
3. lubridate -- handling date/time
4. knitr -- knitr global options for output/file build
5. nortest -- normality testing  
6. plyr -- summarization/aggregation
7. stargazer -- making pretty table outputs easy
```{r}
library(lubridate); library(ggplot2); library(plyr); library(grid); library(nortest); library(stargazer)
```

## Global Functions
None defined yet. Keeping for now.

## Loading the Data Files
All the data files used, including this R-Markdown file with complete source code is available from the github repository at: https://github.com/brockwebb/Sports-Anti-Chafing-Product-Analysis/tree/master/data

```{r}
# Loading all the data sets
dfProduct <- as.data.frame(read.csv("./data/Anti-Chafing-Study-Product_Rating.csv"),strip.white=TRUE, header=TRUE)
dfIngredient <- as.data.frame(read.csv("./data/Anti-Chafing-Study-Ingredients.csv"),strip.white=TRUE, header=TRUE)
dfIngredientDefs <- as.data.frame(read.csv("./data/Anti-Chafing-Study-Ingredient_Defs.csv"),strip.white=TRUE, header=TRUE)

# Data Cleaning
# First, we'll combine all the data tables into one massive join, dropping off things that
# are not important like dates and web reference urls, notes, etc.

dfMergeProductIngredient <- merge(dfProduct,dfIngredient,by="Product_ID", all.x=TRUE)

# Removing some unused columns 
dfMergeProductIngredient$Product_Rating_Date <- NULL
dfMergeProductIngredient$Rating_Source <- NULL
dfMergeProductIngredient$Ingredient_Date <- NULL
dfMergeProductIngredient$Ingredient_Source <- NULL
dfMergeProductIngredient$Ingredient_Notes <- NULL
```

#Exploritory Analysis
```{r}
# The total lnumber of ingredients is the number of rows from the 
# dfIngredientDefs table which has all the ingredients listed
# We could add more later, so not hard coding the values is best...
```
The total number of ingredients in `r nrow(dfProduct)` products is: `r nrow(dfIngredientDefs)`

A tag cloud might be a nice visual. I read a blog on making these in R and reference is my G+ posts when I shared or commented on the article.

This is quite a number of differnent products and most of them are only a few times. This is largely due to either a speciality chemical, fragrances and essential oils, or propellants used in spray-on formulations. Taking a look at a histogram of the distribution will confirm this:

```{r}
# Seeing the frequency of number of overall ingredient counts in different products
subIngredients <- as.data.frame(table(dfMergeProductIngredient$Common_Ingredient_Name))
colnames(subIngredients) <- c("Ingredient","Product_Count")
hist(subIngredients$Product_Count, main="Ingredient frequency in Anti-Chafing Products Studied", xlab="Number of times an ingredient was used", ylab="Frequency Use", col="Red", breaks=30)
```

Another way to say this based on the data is to look at the number of times the ingredients were used only once. Creating a table for the times ingredients were used once, and appearing in up to five products:
```{r}
dfIngredientFrequecy <- count(subIngredients, c("Product_Count"))
dfIngredientFrequecy$Percent_Of_List <- dfIngredientFrequecy$freq/nrow(subIngredients) *100
dfIngredientFrequecy <- dfIngredientFrequecy[order(-dfIngredientFrequecy$Percent_Of_List),]
stargazer(head(dfIngredientFrequecy,5), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=0)  # Display top 5
```
The result is that 88% of all ingredients are used five times or less in 60 products!

Let's look at the names of top ten most common ingredients:
```{r}
# Display top 10 ingredients and the percentage of products they appear in
dfTopIngredients <- as.data.frame(table(dfMergeProductIngredient$Common_Ingredient_Name))
colnames(dfTopIngredients) <- c("Ingredient","Product_Count")
dfTopIngredients$Product_Percent <- round(dfTopIngredients$Product_Count/nrow(dfProduct) * 100, digits=1)
dfTopIngredients <- dfTopIngredients[order(-dfTopIngredients$Product_Count),]
stargazer(head(dfTopIngredients,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=0)  # Display top 10
```

Taking the same idea, we'll look at the products for cyclists separate from the rest:
```{r}
# Display top 10 ingredients and the percentage of products they appear in for Cycling
subBike <-subset(dfMergeProductIngredient, Product_Specific_Use =="Groin")
subBikeProducts <- subset(dfProduct, Product_Specific_Use =="Groin")
dfTopIngredientsBike <- as.data.frame(table(subBike$Common_Ingredient_Name))
colnames(dfTopIngredientsBike) <- c("Ingredient","Product_Count")
dfTopIngredientsBike$Product_Percent <- round(dfTopIngredientsBike$Product_Count/nrow(subBikeProducts) * 100, digits=1)
dfTopIngredientsBike <- dfTopIngredientsBike[order(-dfTopIngredientsBike$Product_Count),]
stargazer(head(dfTopIngredientsBike,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=0)  # Display top 10
```
Of the `r nrow(subBikeProducts)` bike products, 12 of them are water based.

Looking at non-cyclist products:
```{r}
# Display top 10 ingredients and the percentage of products they appear in for Running and 
# General anti-chafe use
subNonBike <-subset(dfMergeProductIngredient, Product_Specific_Use !="Groin")
subNonBikeProducts <- subset(dfProduct, Product_Specific_Use !="Groin")
dfTopIngredientsNonBike <- as.data.frame(table(subNonBike$Common_Ingredient_Name))
colnames(dfTopIngredientsNonBike) <- c("Ingredient","Product_Count")
dfTopIngredientsNonBike$Product_Percent <- round(dfTopIngredientsNonBike$Product_Count/nrow(subNonBikeProducts) * 100, digits=1)
dfTopIngredientsNonBike <- dfTopIngredientsNonBike[order(-dfTopIngredientsNonBike$Product_Count),]
stargazer(head(dfTopIngredientsNonBike,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=0)  # Display top 10
```
Of the `r nrow(subNonBikeProducts)` non-bike products, only 1/3 or so contain water. This is a striking difference and clearly indicates something that needs to be explored further in this analysis.

Out of curiosity for products that are specifically for use (even off-label use) for the feet are probably even more different. Moisture on the feet and the danger of them becoming macerated (the technical term for a whole lot of foot skin damage) would scream for oil-based water repeling care. Hence, I can only imagine the now defunct popular hiker foot care "Hydropel" may have gotten its name from that. For some truely gnarly pictures and descriptions of bad foot maceration in an ultra with some really cool scientific detail on what is happening (well I found it interesting) check out this great article:    
http://www.blisterprevention.com.au/blister-blog/skin-maceration-of-the-feet

Although there are only seven products for specific use on feet, we can go through the same exercise to see the most popular ingredients for those products. When it comes to the off-label use of diaper ointments, I have found they work quite well in the groin area (which is the are they are sold to protect) for running as well (but one must be OK with the cod liver oil smell and white zinc oxide coating). Here are the most popular ingredients for the feet:

```{r}
# Display top 10 ingredients and the percentage of products they appear in for use on
# the feet
subNonBikeFeet <-subset(dfMergeProductIngredient, Product_Specific_Use =="Feet")
subNonBikeProductsFeet <- subset(dfProduct, Product_Specific_Use =="Feet")
dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet <- as.data.frame(table(subNonBikeFeet$Common_Ingredient_Name))
colnames(dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet) <- c("Ingredient","Product_Count")
dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet$Product_Percent <- round(dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet$Product_Count/nrow(subNonBikeProductsFeet) * 100, digits=1)
dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet <- dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet[order(-dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet$Product_Count),]
stargazer(head(dfTopIngredientsNonBikeFeet,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=0)  # Display top 10
```
So, four of seven contain water, but they could simply be an emulsion of oil and water based on achieving a particular viscosity (how easy is it to spread), in connection with certian other ingredients (like glycerins or glycols) or some other characteristic where it is important. 

Breaking things down as a whole, lets look at the total number of different ingredients used, the products with the most and least number of ingredients, and the overall average number of ingredients used with all products.
```{r}
# In the merged dataset, since the products are repeated next to each 
# ingredient in it, we can grab the array of the product names 
# and do the counts as the number of ingredients (this is a simple way)
dfProductCounts <- as.data.frame(table(dfMergeProductIngredient$Product))
colnames(dfProductCounts) <- c("Product","Number_of_Ingredients")
dfProductCounts <- dfProductCounts[order(-dfProductCounts$Number_of_Ingredients),]
```

The top five products with the most ingredients are (last two are a tie):

```{r}
stargazer(head(dfProductCounts,6), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE)  # Display top 5 (#5 and #6 are ties)
```

The five products with the least number of ingredients (which is three or less):
```{r}
stargazer(tail(dfProductCounts,5),type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE)  # Display bottom 5
```

Now let's look at the top rated products, and include the number of reviews:

```{r}
dfProductRank <-subset(dfProduct, select=c(Product,Reviews,Score))
dfProductRank <- dfProductRank[order(-dfProductRank$Score),]
stargazer(head(dfProductRank,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=2)  # Display top 10
```

Some of the top rated products do not have many reviews, meaning that there could be a lot of bias becuase there is not enough information. So, we will only take the top products with more than 10 reviews.

```{r}
dfProductRank <-subset(dfProduct, Reviews >=10, select=c(Product,Reviews,Score))
dfProductRank <- dfProductRank[order(-dfProductRank$Score),]
stargazer(head(dfProductRank,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=2)  # Display top 10
```

That changes things a bit, and gives us greater confidence based on a larger number of user experiences. Because one focus of this analysis is looking at running products, we'll remove the biking and "off-label" ones, and focus on products that have reviews for "sport" use:

```{r}
dfProductRank <-subset(dfProduct, Reviews >=10 & Product_Audience =="Sport" & Product_Audience_Cat2 !="Bike", select=c(Product,Reviews,Score))
dfProductRank <- dfProductRank[order(-dfProductRank$Score),]
stargazer(head(dfProductRank,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=2)  # Display top 10
```

Finially, let's look at products for "general" use and then products specifically advertised for use on the feet. We'll add the product unit cost, but be advised that a little BodyGlide goes a long way, so how much is used per application is different depending on the product. Starting with "general use" products that are advertized for "sports" use first:

```{r}
# Bike products were all specifically used for the "groin" area only, so we can use that to subset the data
dfProductRank <-subset(dfProduct, Reviews >=10 & Product_Audience =="Sport" & Product_Specific_Use !="Groin" & Product_Specific_Use !="Feet" , select=c(Product,Reviews,Score,Product_Unit_Cost,Product_Size_Unit))
dfProductRank <- dfProductRank[order(-dfProductRank$Score),]
stargazer(head(dfProductRank,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=2)  # Display top 10
```

Now we'll widen the general use products to include "general" and "off-label" use as well:

```{r}
# Bike products were all specifically used for the "groin" area only, so we can use that to subset the data
dfProductRank <-subset(dfProduct, Reviews >=10 & Product_Specific_Use !="Groin" & Product_Specific_Use !="Feet" , select=c(Product,Reviews,Score,Product_Unit_Cost,Product_Size_Unit))
dfProductRank <- dfProductRank[order(-dfProductRank$Score),]
stargazer(head(dfProductRank,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=2)  # Display top 10
```


Looking at products for the feet:
```{r}
# Bike products were all specifically used for the "groin" area only, so we can use that to subset the data
dfProductRank <-subset(dfProduct, Reviews >=10 & Product_Audience =="Sport" & Product_Specific_Use !="Groin" & Product_Specific_Use !="General" , select=c(Product,Reviews,Score,Product_Unit_Cost,Product_Size_Unit))
dfProductRank <- dfProductRank[order(-dfProductRank$Score),]
stargazer(head(dfProductRank,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=2)  # Display top 10
```

However, there were a lot of "off-label" uses of products for the feet using baby diaper rash cream, so in fairness, we'll look at all "feet" use with any number of reviews:
```{r}
# Bike products were all specifically used for the "groin" area only, so we can use that to subset the data
dfProductRank <-subset(dfProduct, Product_Specific_Use !="Groin" & Product_Specific_Use !="General" , select=c(Product,Reviews,Score,Product_Unit_Cost,Product_Size_Unit))
dfProductRank <- dfProductRank[order(-dfProductRank$Score),]
stargazer(head(dfProductRank,10), type="text", summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, digits=2)  # Display top 10
```

## Summary of product rankings
Overall, between the different uses (on or off-label) there was not much seperation in product ranking, and durability for an ultramarathon is definitely more important than cost. However, some products certainly cost more than others. It seems for general use, Good ol' petrolatum (petrolium jelly) is dirt cheap and works well. In the next section, we'll explore the relationship between the water based and oil based products to see if there are any signifigant differences.

# Ingredient effect of product rating (Regression Analysis)
Here we will look at the presence of products and possible interaction of ingredients to the product rating. Because "off-label" use may pollute the results (most of the reviews are not from sports use), they are not included. However, fortythree of the sixy procucts have ten or more reviews, so the sample size is good for doing this. 


```{r}
# Getting a subset of the merged product list with 10 or more reviews and a list with
# no off-label use
subProductsIngredientsTenPlusReviewsNoOffLabel <- subset(dfMergeProductIngredient, Reviews >=10 & Product_Audience !="Off-Label")
subProductListTenPlusReviewsNoOffLabel <- subset(dfProduct, Reviews >=10 & Product_Audience !="Off-Label")
```

Making a chord diagram to visualize relationships
```{r}
# Uses Libraries
#library(circlize) (need to put these in the init section later)
#library(reshape)

# First we must view each product has having a destination to each ingredient
# If a product has an ingredient, it's amount is "1" and if it
# does not have an ingredient, then it's relationship is "0"

# Get a subset of products with their ingredients only
tsub1 <- subset(subProductsIngredientsTenPlusReviewsNoOffLabel, select=c(Product, Common_Ingredient_Name))

# This makes a table of all prodcuts in rows, all ingredients in the columns
# where a "1" means 'true' or it has that ingredient, a '0' for false or 
# it does not contain it...
tsub2 <- cast(tsub1, Product ~ Common_Ingredient_Name)

# Convert the table to matrix and delete the first column
tsub3 <- data.matrix(subset(tsub2, select = -c(1)))

# set Matrix Row and Column names
rownames(tsub3) <- tsub2$Product
colnames(tsub3) <- colnames(tsub3)

#chordDiagram(tsub3)

```
# Ingredient cluster analysis
Here we will look to see if there are clusters of products that are typical and see the effect on the product rating.

A chord diagram might be a good visual.
