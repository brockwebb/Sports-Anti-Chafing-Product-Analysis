# Sports-Anti-Chafing-Product-Analysis
There are many different anti-chafing products on the market for athletes. This project serves not only as a database or catalogue of the various products, but serves as an analysis of the different ingredients used. Through the comparison of products and their ratings, the hope is to uncover the relationship between the best products and/or ingredients to make smarter buying decisions based on the formulation. Obviously, there is individual preference, body chemistry at play, as well as individual use and expectations for skin sensitivity, durability, etc.  

# Current Tasks
* Complete data gathering: 60 products desired; 56/60 products collected
* Data Cleanup (not started)
* Publish data files to the repo (not started)
* Create a summary page of all products, links, ratings, ingredients (not started)
* Create a tag-cloud to identify most common ingredients (not started)
* Look for correlations between ingredients and product rating (not started)
* Perform a cluster analysis to see if any patterns emerge (not started)
* Other analysis as a result of exploratory work (not started)
* Publish a full report of all data and work (not started, but thoughts in my head)
* Create an infographic (not started but thoughts in my head)
* Write up an article for publication (not started, but thoughts in my head)

# Some initial insights
* There is a market of "off-label" use of products not marketed as "sports" products that people use (I even use some, one that is intended for horses... but I'm a running horse, right? lol)
* People have gone down the "advanced potions class" or alchemist route to create their own formulation to suit their needs and provide cost effective replacements for popular products
* Neat tricks, like using an old deodorant container for no-mess application are interesting hacks
* Many off-label products for use exist, but they are not included unless I found that people were using them via a blog or discussion thread for off-label use, or that I am using those products myself for that purpose
* Its hard to distinguish many "lotions" from anti-chafe products! So this contributes to the many off-label uses case :)
