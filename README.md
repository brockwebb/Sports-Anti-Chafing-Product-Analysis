# Sports-Anti-Chafing-Product-Analysis
There are many different anti-chafing products on the market for athletes. This project serves not only as a database or catalogue of the various products, but serves as an analysis of the different ingredients used. Through the comparison of products and their ratings, the hope is to uncover the relationship between the best products and/or ingredients to make smarter buying decisions based on the formulation. Obviously, there is individual preference, body chemistry at play, as well as individual use and expectations for skin sensitivity, durability, etc.
